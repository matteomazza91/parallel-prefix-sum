# parallel-prefix-sum
parallel-prefix-sum is a parallelization study of the prefix-sum algorithm written in C with posix_thread to be executed in a shared memory environment. The tests were done on the massive parallel xeon phi processor.

All the performance plots realized are obtained by appropriate averaging the execution times of the implemented algorithms.

Each algorithm is tested on different commutative and associative functions.
